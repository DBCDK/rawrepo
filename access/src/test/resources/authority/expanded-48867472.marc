504 00 *a "It hasn't taken Stick In The Wheel long to progress from puckish upstarts to critical darlings ... But success hasn't mellowed them. On Hold Fast - their third album proper - they are more searingly honest and politically charged than ever, while their music retains all the DIY energy that made them such a refreshing addition to the music scene. They now operate as a duo of core members Nicola Kearey (vocals) and Ian Carter (guitar and production), but the cast of co-contributors is impressive, and they seem more like a band than ever ... An urgent and quite brilliant album"
